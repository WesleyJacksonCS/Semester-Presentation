This presentation provides an overview of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on how humans interact with digital systems to improve usability and design. It covers the evolution of HCI, from its early emphasis on desktop computers in the 1980s to the rise of 
mobile phones, the internet, and the development of UX design in the 1990s. The field continues to evolve with advancements in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human Data Interaction (HDI), which are shaping the future of technology.
As digital technology becomes increasingly embedded in our daily lives, HCI remains essential in ensuring systems are intuitive, accessible, and meets the needs of users.
